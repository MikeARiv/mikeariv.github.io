## Refinement Plan & Code Review

**Category One: Software Engineering/Design**

To show refinement in my abilities relating to software engineering and design, I have chosen work from CS340.  This artifact will help show my abilities to work with python, as well as client/server integration.  Specifically, this will require enhancement of the python code to pass in usernames and passwords, through user input, and validation of said user via stored credentials in a database.

Pseudocode:
	Update CRUD Operations for username and password
	Define a function to accept user input for username and password
	While loop to validate username and password in stored database, till found
	Else close application

This enhancement will establish new functionality that ensure the security of the system, and present a grander scope of employment, vice single person sign on that would have to be changed constantly.  


**Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures**

To define more secure methods of user credential storage, I have chosen work from CS340 to showcase this aspect.  The utilization of python will also be utilized for this category.  This artifact will specifically show the ability of encryption/decryption of passwords to databases.

Pseudocode:
	Define a function to accept user input for username and password
	Translate and encrypt password for storage in database
	Ability to call username and encrypted password to validate user from a database

The scope of these update will provide more security to the current system.  Having account passwords in the clear form can potentially lead to comprise of a system.  Updating this seems vital to maintain system integrity.  

  
**Category Three: Databases**

Lastly, I will be utilizing artifacts from CS340 to show utilization of database queries, to display users from the database to specific organizations around the world.  This will be done with MySQL to analyze the data and plot users under company locations on a plotly map.  This will additionally have to be displayed in a web browser

Pseudocode:
	Query functionality and ability to find records
	Ability to Create, Read, Update and Delete Records

Development of this segment will increase the ability to understand queries in a more human readable format.  Given the wealth of data provide by most databases, having the ability to “clean it up”, will show the refinement of database skills I have learned while with SNHU.
