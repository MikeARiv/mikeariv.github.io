## Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

The artifact utilized is the same as enhancement one but refined with concepts from a previous course where we developed a  zookeeper application.  Implementation of while loops were utilized to ensure user attempted logons will be limited, plus encryption utilized for password information to be stored in credentials.txt.  This application was initially created by me in April of 2019 but enhanced with work learned throughout the entire Computer Science curriculum with SNHU.

Use of this artifact was something that I truly enjoyed to show specifically my concentration in information security.  To enhance one's ability to develop code in a way that stops erroneous input, as well as ensuring that the correct input is used, is something I have had interest in for the past few years.  The specific components enhanced:

-Define a function to accept user input for username and password

-Translate and encrypt password for storage in database

-Ability to call username and encrypted password to validate user from a database.

Implementation of credentials.txt was used to simulate the database in use, where the logon for MongoDB was developed in Enhancment Three.  Additionally, enhancements were made to identify information through more commenting relative to requirements for the defined function or line of code.

In this iteration, the conduct of establishing encryption in Python seemed to be something I was having issues with.  Mainly because of the import modules and not understanding the full setup of said modules like bcrypt.  Java seems to run better functionality with integration of tools to encrypt based on functions made.  I plan to further my development with Python in understanding modules imported and their functionality with applications I will develop in the future.
