Beginning stages of ePortfolio.

### Artifact 1 

Software Design / Enginnering:

  Initial development for a Python Login system pulling credentials from a database.  For ease of use, a .txt file was used.  Update as needed to check functionality on your file system.  This artifact was inspired by aspects of previous systems made in java and python.  Additionaly functionality to be added with encryption in the coming weeks.

  Enhancements provided:
  
  Creation code for username and password.
  Read elements from a database
  Update and append user accounts to database
  ***Delete function pending***

# Example code snippet of enhancements:

def registration():
    db = open("credentials.txt" , "r") #For ease of access, we are using a text file as database and the r option for read
    username = input("Create username:") #pass in username for registration
    password = input("Create password:") #pass in password for registration
    password1 = input("Please confirm your password:") #validation of password
    d = [] #store username
    f = [] #store password

    for i in db:
        a,b = i.split(", ") #remove comma and space so password stands alone if we print it out
        b = b.strip()
        d.append(a) #ability to append username
        f.append(b) #ability to append password
    data = dict(zip(d, f))
    
    if password !=  password1: #validation of created password
        print("Password validation did not succeed, please confirm your password")
        registration()
    else:
        if len(password) <= 5: #set limit of 5 for password length.  Adjust to your password requirements, Length of 15 recommended
            print("Password is too short, please utilize a minimum of 5 characters") #update as required for character length change
            registration()
        elif username in db: #check to see if username exist
            print("Username exist")
            registration()
        else: #allow append of username and password
            db = open("credentials.txt" , "a")
            db.write(username+", "+password+ "\n")
            print("***User Creation Was Successful***")
```
