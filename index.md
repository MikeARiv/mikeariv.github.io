## Introduction

Since 2002 I have been studying in IT developing myself and teams I work with in the military.  This knowledge ranges in the form of understanding of development and deployment of different Windows Systems like Server, Client and Exchange, to Cisco Networking, CompTIA Network and Security+, Certified Ethical Hacker, and more recently with Computer Science through Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).  My overall intent and goal was to enchance my capabilities in understanding all things computer related and ensure the systems and information are secure from advanced persistent threats.


## Educational Reflection

As of late, in completion of my degree with SNHU, I have learned that systems are only as secure as the ourself and our teams ability and knowledge of security.  This means that no matter how much we secure a system, their may be another way for someone to penetrate the system based on a limitation we pose internal to our team.  For this, I believe it is important to utilize concepts, like those learned in Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), so we can update and review applications as needed.  Additonally, concept like Agile Methodology will help me in developing my team of developers in the milestones needed to meet the SDLC approach.  I have a firm belief in fail fast, where we learn from our mistakes early on, to ensure we same the organization money, and embaressment from faulty applications.
