## Introduction

Since 2002 I have been studying in IT developing myself and teams I work with in the military.  This knowledge ranges in the form of understanding of development and deployment of different Windows Systems like Server, Client and Exchange, to Cisco Networking, CompTIA Network and Security+, Certified Ethical Hacker, and more recently with Computer Science through Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU).  My overall intent and goal was to enchance my capabilities in understanding all things computer related and ensure the systems and information are secure from advanced persistent threats.


## Educational Reflection

As of late, in completion of my degree with Southern New Hampshire University, I have learned that systems are only as secure as the ourself and our teams ability and knowledge of security.  This means that no matter how much we secure a system, their may be another way for someone to penetrate the system based on a limitation we pose internal to our team.  For this, I believe it is important to utilize concepts, like those learned in Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), so we can update and review applications as needed.  Additonally, concept like Agile Methodology will help me in developing my team of developers in the milestones needed to meet the SDLC approach.  I have a firm belief in fail fast, where we learn from our mistakes early on, to ensure we same the organization money, and embaressment from faulty applications.  This way of collaboration can enable strong bonds within the organizationa and build teams through a very systematic approach that can enable them in understanding all aspects of the code written.

Additonaly, I have designed several different artifacts and enhancments of code that can produce measurable results into an organzation through effeciency and replication, via technically sound code as well as visually apealing.  I have developed a better understanding to commenting and how it reflects a transfer of knowledge between dev teams.  This also reflects in some of the code I have developed utilizing algorithims and RESTfulapi like that of my fidofinder.py application.  Utilizing techniques through the entire computer science curriculum, along with research and training through several websites online, helped me develop and implement cutting edge technology to meet these types of future needs.

Most of all, with my focus in Information Security, I developed an enhanced understanding to minimize potential vulnerabilities and to mitigate risk by ensuring design flaws are fixed accordingly.  These concepts can be seen in the security of my applicaitons via encryption and database username and password requirements.


## Portfolio Summary

The overall intent of this portfolio was to showcase some of the work accomplished throughout my undergradute with Souther New Hampshire University, in Computer Science with a concentration in Information Security.  The outcomes expected are to show my ability to strategize and employ applications, design and review code for understanding, display enhanced algorithmic logic for security purposes, implement computer solutions for business to business or business to customer relationships, and to ensure security by mitigating design flaws.  All of these are present in my enhancements where you can see more and read about what was conducted to ensure these concepts were fulfilled.

## Preparing For The Future

As I develop my skills further in software development, I plan to further research tools like Node.js, React and Django.  I have grown to love the development portion to have an impact on business and customers based on the amount of work put into it.  Learning the business aspect and how to employ this systems on a larger scale is what I want to better understand and work with, thus reasoning for looking into internships with several companies.
